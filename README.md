# GenoPriGas
Strategic Genomic Privacy Game Solver (GenoPriGas)

Description:

This program finds the best solution for sharing genomic summary statistics (MAF of SNPs) under an economically motivated recipient(adversary)'s inference attack based on a Stackelberg game model named Genomic Privacy Game.  The inference attack is to infer if a targeted DNA is in a genome pool with publised summary statistics (i.e. minor allele frequency of SNPs).  The sharer's strategy set is (relaxed) not limited to releasing only top SNPs.  Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the best solution, especially for large scale datasets.
